The Titanic project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
The project will use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model based on passenger information such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare.
By analyzing these factors, the project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

The project will start with data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns that may be useful for prediction. 
Feature engineering may be used to create new features that could improve the model's performance.

Several machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, will be trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation will be used to optimize the selected model and improve its accuracy.

The project will also focus on model evaluation and interpretation, aiming to understand the factors that influence survival rates on the Titanic. 
Visualization techniques will be used to visualize the model's performance and gain insights into the importance of different features in predicting survival.
